##Diver:  Dynamic Interactive Views For Reverse Engineering

###Diver has been retired. Thanks for your support of our research project!

Diver is a set of advanced tools for debugging and reverse engineering. If you ever wondered, "What did my program just do?", Diver will help you find the answer.  Diver is a set of Eclipse plugins that aid developers in understanding software. It uses dynamic analysis and reverse engineering to offer views and filters that aid comprehension and discovery.

Diver allows you to:

* Easily trace your Java programs
* Visualize your program's runtime functionality
* Filter your IDE based on what occurs at runtime
* See what code ran in your source code editors
* And generally understand your software better

For more about Diver, visit [the website](http://eclipsediver.wordpress.com "Diver on Wordpress"), view the [documents](http://eclipsediver.wordpress.com/docs "Diver Docs"), or follow us at [@eclipsediver](https://twitter.com/eclipsediver "Diver on Twitter").

###Requirements:

In order to run, Diver needs:

* Windows XP or above, or Linux. 
* 32-bit or 64-bit Java for Windows. Only 32-bit Java supported on Linux.
* Eclipse 32-bit or 64-bit for Windows, or Eclipse 32-bit for Linux
